## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

In this challenge called:"QR code component". I learned how to use a CSS @media query to make mobile friendly.

```css
@media (max-width: 503px) {
  .square {
    position: absolute;
    left: 150px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I still have to learn @media query deeply and how to Code refactoring process.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp) - This helped me for understanding Media Queries. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
